Beta Files
==========

Here be dragons!

There were some minor changes made to the badge firmware too late to make the final load to the badges.

These files _should_ work with the stock firmware -- just copy them over the existing files. If that causes problems,
simply copy the originals back from the source directory to recover (and report any problems, please).

The .diff files will show you the differences, if you are curious.
