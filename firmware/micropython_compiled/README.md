Firmware images for the Micropython builds for the badge.  These are just the Micropython, none of our badge code.

Note these come in Pico and Pico_W flavors.  Choose wisely.

These are compiled with [gc9a01_mpy](https://github.com/russhughes/gc9a01_mpy) screen driver and [a recent pull request](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/7641) that provides interrupt request support for the DMA subsystem.
